I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The patient is a woman, now 20 y of age, who had been admitted to the hospital at the age of nine years because of psychomotoric retardation and marfanoid features such as excessive height, dolichostenomelia, and arachnodactyly.  At present time, i.e., 11 y after diagnosing and start of therapy, she is in a very good physical condition and her intellectual development has reached an average level. Her length is 182 cm and weight 75 kg. She has not any physical complaint. Ectopia lentis, osteoporosis, and vascular complications did not occur until now. Hyperhomocysteinemia and hypermethioninemia were observed in our patient when compared to controls.
