I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband is an affected female who was first evaluated at the age of 24, when she presented with a gout attack and hyperuricemia.  At age 27 she was told having renal failure. However, a renal biopsy was not performed.  At age 44, serum creatinine was 2.8 mg/dl and ultrasound imaging detected numerous renal cysts.  Renal disease slowly progressed and the patient reached ESRD when she was 49 years old.  Her father died at the age of 55 from ESRD and suffered from hyperuricemia and gout.  The proband's only son is also affected. At the age of 18 years he had a gout attack.  On the initial evaluation, serum uric acid was 15 mg/dl and serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dl.  Renal cysts were also detected on ultrasound examination.
