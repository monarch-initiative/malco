I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 1-year, 6-month old girl. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
She presented with Epicanthus, Long philtrum, Synophrys, Microcephaly, Broad nasal tip, Depressed nasal bridge, High palate, Short chin, Posteriorly rotated ears, Low-set ears, Seizure, Global developmental delay, Delayed ability to walk, Delayed speech and language development, Intellectual disability, Ventriculomegaly, and Brachycephaly. However, the following features were excluded: Short stature, Decreased body weight, Intrauterine growth retardation, Postnatal growth retardation, Smooth philtrum, Telecanthus, Wide nasal bridge, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Triangular face, Torticollis, Hyperactivity, Broad-based gait, Clinodactyly, Small hand, Sacral dimple, Deep palmar crease, Bilateral single transverse palmar creases, Atrial septal defect, Small joint hypermobilty, Broad hallux, Pes planus, Macrodontia, Nevus flammeus of the forehead, Malar rash, Pointed chin, Malar flattening, and Strabismus.
