I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 3-year, 3-month old girl. Disease onset was not specified.
She presented with Wide nasal bridge, Depressed nasal tip, Strabismus, Long palpebral fissure, Eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids, Prominent fingertip pads, Hypotonia, Global developmental delay, Highly arched eyebrow, Macrotia, and Finger clinodactyly. However, the following features were excluded: Multicystic kidney dysplasia, Ureteral duplication, Renal duplication, Ectopic kidney, Hearing impairment, Ptosis, Blue sclerae, Sacral dimple, Seizure, Congenital hip dislocation, Joint hypermobility, Hypoplastic left heart, Ventricular septal defect, Atrial septal defect, Patent ductus arteriosus, Aortic valve stenosis, Scimitar anomaly, Interrupted aortic arch, Coarctation of aorta, Scoliosis, Recurrent infections, Short stature, and Chiari type I malformation.
