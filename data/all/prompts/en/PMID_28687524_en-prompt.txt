I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was an individual. Disease onset was not specified.
The individual presented with Disturbed sensory perception, Chiari malformation, Hypertension, Hyperkinetic movements, Lethargy, Decreased fetal movement, Snoring, Respiratory distress, Jaundice, Sepsis, Global developmental delay, Submucous cleft palate, Recurrent ear infections, Allergic rhinitis, Lethargy, Chronic constipation, Strabismus, Bilateral cryptorchidism, Talipes, Oral aversion, High anterior hairline, Narrow palpebral fissure, Macrotia, Short columella, Wide mouth, Short chin, Thoracolumbar scoliosis, Camptodactyly, Short 5th finger, Overlapping toe, Lethargy, Small nail, Lethargy, Chiari malformation, Lethargy, Bronchogenic cyst, Lethargy, Thoracic scoliosis, Thoracolumbar scoliosis, Lethargy, Hydronephrosis, Renal cyst, and Renal diverticulum. However, the following features were excluded: Orthopnea and Talipes.
