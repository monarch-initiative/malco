I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was an individual. Disease onset was not specified.
The individual presented with Nail dysplasia, Brachydactyly, Clinodactyly, Mesomelia, Hemivertebrae, Short palm, Pectus excavatum, Syndactyly, Scoliosis, Short philtrum, Gingival overgrowth, Wide nasal bridge, Micrognathia, Midface retrusion, Prominent forehead, Retrognathia, Short nose, Triangular mouth, Long eyelashes, Anteverted nares, Bifid tongue, Proptosis, Hypertelorism, Short stature, Hearing impairment, Low-set ears, Limited pronation/supination of forearm, Upslanted palpebral fissure, and Microglossia. However, the following features were excluded: Single transverse palmar crease, Sacral dimple, Melanocytic nevus, Broad thumb, Camptodactyly, Hip dislocation, Broad hallux, Rib fusion, Orofacial cleft, Long philtrum, Downturned corners of mouth, Narrow palate, Short neck, Depressed nasal bridge, Long palpebral fissure, Thin upper lip vermilion, Epicanthus, Ptosis, Strabismus, Hypoplastic labia majora, Hypoplastic labia minora, Microtia, Abnormal heart morphology, Inguinal hernia, and Downslanted palpebral fissures.
