I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 19-year-old woman. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
She presented with Splenomegaly, Neonatal omphalitis, Recurrent fever, Anemia, Partial absence of specific antibody response to unconjugated pneumococcus vaccine, Immunodeficiency, Verrucae, Elevated haptoglobin level, Elevated circulating C-reactive protein concentration, Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Candida esophagitis, Intermittent diarrhea, Postnatal growth retardation, and Decreased proportion of memory T cells. However, the following features were excluded: Global developmental delay, Eczematoid dermatitis, Abnormal circulating creatine kinase concentration, and Clubbing.
At an age of 17 years, she presented with Lower limb muscle weakness, Skeletal muscle atrophy, and Fatty replacement of skeletal muscle. 
At an age of 16 years, she presented with Intestinal lymphangiectasia. 
At an age of 9 years, she presented with Decreased circulating IgG level, Reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation, T lymphocytopenia, Partial absence of specific antibody response to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, and Hypoalbuminemia.
