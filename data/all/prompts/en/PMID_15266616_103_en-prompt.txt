I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 13-year-old adolescent girl. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
She presented with Trigonocephaly, High forehead, Broad forehead, Round face, Broad face, Hypertelorism, Epicanthus, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Ptosis, Esodeviation, Wide nasal bridge, Bulbous nose, Long philtrum, Smooth philtrum, Thin upper lip vermilion, Microtia, Low-set ears, Small thenar eminence, Small hypothenar eminence, Talipes equinovarus, Hallux valgus, Short toe, Toe clinodactyly, and Abnormality of the genital system. However, the following features were excluded: Flat occiput, Prominent occiput, Prominent forehead, Narrow forehead, Flat face, Triangular face, Thick eyebrow, Sparse eyebrow, Highly arched eyebrow, Long eyelashes, Deeply set eye, Proptosis, Iris coloboma, Cataract, Ectopia lentis, Exodeviation, Long nose, Anteverted nares, Hypoplastic nasal tip, Low hanging columella, Short philtrum, Deep philtrum, Thick upper lip vermilion, Thin lower lip vermilion, Thick lower lip vermilion, Everted lower lip vermilion, High palate, Cleft palate, Abnormal dental morphology, Full cheeks, Posteriorly rotated ears, Conductive hearing impairment, Low anterior hairline, Brittle hair, Short neck, Webbed neck, Broad thumb, Pes planus, Long hallux, and Umbilical hernia.
