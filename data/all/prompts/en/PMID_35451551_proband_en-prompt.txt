I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 23-year-old man. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
He presented with Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, Feeding difficulties, Short palpebral fissure, Prominent nasal bridge, Underdeveloped tragus, High palate, Midface retrusion, Secondary microcephaly, Bicuspid aortic valve, Aortic root aneurysm, Intellectual disability, mild, Global developmental delay, Motor delay, Delayed speech and language development, Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, Recurrent respiratory infections, Brachydactyly, Pectus carinatum, Syndactyly, and Tracheomalacia. However, the following features were excluded: Inguinal hernia, Umbilical hernia, Dental crowding, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Depressed nasal bridge, Bulbous nose, Epicanthus, Open mouth, Long philtrum, Smooth philtrum, Micrognathia, Hypoplasia of teeth, Thin upper lip vermilion, Retrognathia, Sparse eyebrow, Preauricular skin tag, Pulmonic stenosis, Patent ductus arteriosus, Ventricular hypertrophy, Ventricular septal defect, Anteverted ears, Low-set ears, Posteriorly rotated ears, Hypermetropia, Hypertelorism, Nystagmus, Cataract, Astigmatism, Retinal coloboma, Iris coloboma, Recurrent otitis media, and Increased nuchal translucency.
As an infant, he presented with Hypotonia.
