I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 3-year, 8-month old boy. Disease onset was not specified.
He presented with Unilateral ptosis, Delayed ability to walk, Feeding difficulties, Hypotonia, Hyperactivity, Short palpebral fissure, Preauricular pit, Simple febrile seizure, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Delayed fine motor development, Hypertelorism, Retrognathia, Astigmatism, Micrognathia, Delayed speech and language development, Intellectual disability, Tented upper lip vermilion, Polyhydramnios, Deeply set eye, Sparse eyebrow, Macrotia, Short neck, Delayed ability to sit, Large earlobe, Global developmental delay, Amblyopia, Prominent forehead, High anterior hairline, Glossoptosis, Posteriorly rotated ears, Bilateral ptosis, Strabismus, Anteverted nares, Cleft palate, Wide mouth, and Narrow nasal bridge. However, the following features were excluded: Autistic behavior, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Hearing impairment.
