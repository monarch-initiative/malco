I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 15-year-old adolescent girl. Disease onset occurred when the proband was 5-year, 0-month old.
She presented with Resting tremor. However, the following features were excluded: Abnormal circulating lactate dehydrogenase concentration and Abnormal circulating creatine kinase concentration.
At an age of 10 years, she presented with Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure with generalized onset and Difficulty climbing stairs. 
At an age of 15 years, she presented with Gowers sign, Waddling gait, Neck muscle weakness, Hyporeflexia, Tongue fasciculations, Tongue atrophy, and Weakness of facial musculature. 
At an age of 7 years, she presented with Myoclonus.
