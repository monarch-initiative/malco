I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 11-year-old adolescent boy. Disease onset was not specified.
He presented with Plagiocephaly, Ptosis, Feeding difficulties, Hypertelorism, Short philtrum, Sleep abnormality, Cerebral cortical atrophy, Coarse facial features, Scoliosis, Strabismus, Low anterior hairline, Thick eyebrow, Bulbous nose, Everted lower lip vermilion, Highly arched eyebrow, Long eyelashes, Severe global developmental delay, Seizure, Short stature, Hypopigmentation of the fundus, Thick nasal alae, Thick upper lip vermilion, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Broad philtrum, Macrotia, Pectus excavatum, Thick lower lip vermilion, Failure to thrive, Micrognathia, Intellectual disability, and Hypotonia. However, the following features were excluded: Macrocephaly, Microcephaly, Triangular face, Narrow forehead, Midface retrusion, Dolichocephaly, Blue sclerae, Hypertonia, Hearing impairment, Epicanthus, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Depressed nasal bridge, Wide nose, Anteverted nares, Thin upper lip vermilion, Wide mouth, Downturned corners of mouth, Craniosynostosis, Delayed skeletal maturation, Brachydactyly, Clinodactyly, Absent distal phalanges, Prominent interphalangeal joints, Joint hypermobility, Sparse scalp hair, Hypertrichosis, Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nails, Orofacial cleft, Recurrent otitis media, Laryngotracheomalacia, Mild global developmental delay, Moderate global developmental delay, Autistic behavior, Reduced cerebral white matter volume, and Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
