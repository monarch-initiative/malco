I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 15-year-old adolescent boy. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
He presented with Cleft palate, Cleft lip, Bronchomalacia, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, Overriding aorta, Ventricular septal defect, Prominent nasal bridge, Cryptorchidism, Postural instability, Internal carotid artery hypoplasia, Intellectual disability, Recurrent otitis media, and Hypoplasia of the semicircular canal. However, the following features were excluded: Retrognathia, Micropenis, Incomplete partition of the cochlea type II, Supraventricular tachycardia, Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve, Atrial septal defect, Poor suck, Gastroesophageal reflux, and Congestive heart failure.
During the fetal period, he presented with Polyhydramnios. 
At an age of 15 years, he presented with Long face and Narrow mouth.
