I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 19-year-old man. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
He presented with Chordee, Hypospadias, Postaxial foot polydactyly, Postaxial hand polydactyly, 3-4 finger cutaneous syndactyly, Global developmental delay, and Intellectual disability. However, the following features were excluded: Diabetes mellitus.
During the fetal period, he presented with Intrauterine growth retardation and Multicystic kidney dysplasia. 
At an age of 14 years, he presented with Dilatation of the renal pelvis, Chronic kidney disease, Polyuria, Polydipsia, Hypertension, Rod-cone dystrophy, Nyctalopia, Peripheral visual field loss, Obesity, Round face, Deeply set eye, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Short palpebral fissure, Bulbous nose, Smooth philtrum, and Thin vermilion border. 
At an age of 19 years, he presented with Moderate myopia and Ultra-low vision with retained light projection.
