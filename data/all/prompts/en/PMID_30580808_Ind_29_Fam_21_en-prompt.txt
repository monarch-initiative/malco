I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 13-year-old adolescent boy. Disease onset was not specified.
He presented with Macrocephaly, Triangular face, Strabismus, Seizure, Hypotonia, Hypertonia, Prominent forehead, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Thick nasal alae, Low-set ears, Posteriorly rotated ears, Uplifted earlobe, Microtia, Sparse eyebrow, High palate, Short neck, Narrow mouth, Low posterior hairline, Scoliosis, Joint hypermobility, Sparse scalp hair, Feeding difficulties, Failure to thrive, Short stature, Intellectual disability, Severe global developmental delay, and Reduced cerebral white matter volume. However, the following features were excluded: Plagiocephaly, Microcephaly, Narrow forehead, Midface retrusion, Dolichocephaly, Blue sclerae, Ptosis, Hypopigmentation of the fundus, EEG abnormality, Hearing impairment, Thick eyebrow, Long eyelashes, Hypertelorism, Epicanthus, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Depressed nasal bridge, Wide nose, Anteverted nares, Broad philtrum, Short philtrum, Thin upper lip vermilion, Thick lower lip vermilion, Wide mouth, Downturned corners of mouth, Macrotia, Protruding ear, Simple ear, Craniosynostosis, Pectus excavatum, Brachydactyly, Clinodactyly, Absent distal phalanges, Prominent interphalangeal joints, Hypertrichosis, Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nails, Microdontia, Orofacial cleft, Sleep abnormality, Recurrent otitis media, Laryngotracheomalacia, Mild global developmental delay, Moderate global developmental delay, Autistic behavior, Cerebral cortical atrophy, and Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
