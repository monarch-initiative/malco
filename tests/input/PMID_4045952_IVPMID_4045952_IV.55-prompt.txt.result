Based on the clinical features presented in the case, here is the list of differential diagnoses ranked by probability:

1. OMIM:300751 - X-linked Sideroblastic Anemia with Ataxia
2. OMIM:300115 - Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Autosomal Recessive 1 (SCAR1)
3. OMIM:301310 - Pearlman Syndrome
4. OMIM:312750 - Friedreich Ataxia with Retained Reflexes
5. OMIM:500011 - Congenital Sideroblastic Anemia B

Given the combination of neurological symptoms and specific anemia findings, X-linked Sideroblastic Anemia with Ataxia appears to be the most probable diagnosis.
