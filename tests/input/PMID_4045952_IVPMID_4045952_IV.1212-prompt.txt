I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts. I am going to give you part of a medical case. You are not trying to treat any patients. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4,” an AI language model who is providing a diagnosis Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be specified with the OMIM identifier and disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. OMIM:113620 - Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. OMIM:219700 - Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable.

You do not need to explain your reasoning, just list the diagnoses together with the OMIM identifiers.
Here is the case:
