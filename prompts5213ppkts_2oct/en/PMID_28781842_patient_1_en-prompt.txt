I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 1-year, 3-month old girl. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a 7-month-old.
She presented with Microcephaly, Failure to thrive, Global developmental delay, Epicanthus, High palate, Low-set ears, Thick eyebrow, Downturned corners of mouth, Depressed nasal bridge, Anteverted nares, Highly arched eyebrow, Retrognathia, Short neck, Short chin, Narrow forehead, Long eyelashes, Curly eyelashes, Dermatochalasis, Synophrys, Clinodactyly of the 5th finger, Short 4th metacarpal, 2-3 toe syndactyly, Short 5th finger, Short 5th metacarpal, Proximal placement of thumb, Ptosis, Delayed gross motor development, Low anterior hairline, Patent foramen ovale, and Cutis marmorata. However, the following features were excluded: Prominent nasal bridge, Broad nasal tip, and Hirsutism.
As an infant, she presented with Feeding difficulties.
