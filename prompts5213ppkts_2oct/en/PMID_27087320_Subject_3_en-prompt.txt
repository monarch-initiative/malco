I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 2-year, 4-month old boy. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
He presented with 3-4 finger syndactyly, Prominent stem of antihelix, Preauricular pit, Anterior creases of earlobe, Epicanthus, Micrognathia, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Hypotelorism, Vesicoureteral reflux, Short stature, Microphthalmia, Peters anomaly, Reduced cerebral white matter volume, Ventriculomegaly, Autistic behavior, Thin corpus callosum, Global developmental delay, Intellectual disability, Ventricular septal defect, and Annular pancreas. However, the following features were excluded: Anteverted nares, Wide mouth, Cleft lip, Smooth philtrum, Low anterior hairline, Narrow forehead, Prominent forehead, Bulbous nose, Macrocephaly, Plagiocephaly, Midface retrusion, Triangular face, Broad alveolar ridges, High palate, Blepharophimosis, Frontal bossing, Broad eyebrow, Deeply set eye, Depressed nasal bridge, Hypoplastic helices, Cupped ear, Overfolded helix, Synophrys, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Hypertelorism, Simple ear, Choanal atresia, Cryptorchidism, Hypospadias, Intrauterine growth retardation, Ptosis, Coloboma, Delayed CNS myelination, Hypoplastic anterior commissure, Hypoplasia of the pons, Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Dysarthria, Focal impaired awareness seizure, Hypotonia, Spastic tetraparesis, Patent ductus arteriosus, Anomalous pulmonary venous return, Patent foramen ovale, Low-set ears, Posteriorly rotated ears, Sensorineural hearing impairment, Renal cyst, Clinodactyly of the 5th finger, Single transverse palmar crease, Broad thumb, Head-banging, Lumbar hyperlordosis, Poor suck, Inverted nipples, and Scoliosis.
During the fetal period, he presented with Renal hypoplasia, Duodenal atresia, and Polyhydramnios.
