I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 14-year-old adolescent girl. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
She presented with Choanal atresia, Widely spaced teeth, Microdontia, Hypoparathyroidism, Hypothyroidism, Intellectual disability, mild, Global developmental delay, Gastroesophageal reflux, Absent nipple, Severe short stature, Clinodactyly of the 5th finger, Postnatal growth retardation, and Short nose. However, the following features were excluded: Posteriorly rotated ears, Underdeveloped nasal alae, Depressed nasal tip, Depressed nasal ridge, Persistence of primary teeth, Dental malocclusion, Hypoplastic nipples, Aplasia of the semicircular canal, and Branchial sinus.
At an age of 6 months, she presented with Bilateral renal hypoplasia. 
At an age of 14 years, she presented with Thin vermilion border, High forehead, Low-set ears, and Preauricular pit. 
As a neonate, she presented with Sensorineural hearing impairment.
