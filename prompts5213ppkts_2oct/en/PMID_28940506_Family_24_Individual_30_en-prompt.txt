I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 18-year-old man. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
He presented with Feeding difficulties, Ataxia, Global developmental delay, Enlarged cisterna magna, Hypotonia, Small for gestational age, Increased circulating lactate concentration, and Neutropenia. However, the following features were excluded: Focal impaired awareness seizure, Infantile spasms, Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure with generalized onset, Ventriculomegaly, Short stature, Failure to thrive, Periventricular cysts, Thin corpus callosum, Cerebellar atrophy, Cerebral atrophy, Epicanthus, Thick eyebrow, Long philtrum, Micrognathia, Smooth philtrum, Wide nasal bridge, Microcephaly, Long eyelashes, Prominent forehead, Short palpebral fissure, Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Patent foramen ovale, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Supraventricular tachycardia, Tetralogy of Fallot, Strabismus, Nystagmus, Optic atrophy, Reduced visual acuity, Hypertelorism, Ptosis, Cryptorchidism, Hypospadias, Hyperammonemia, Recurrent infections, Hearing impairment, Low-set ears, and Premature birth.
