I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 3-year, 1-month old girl. Disease onset was not specified.
She presented with Strabismus, Thick eyebrow, Anteverted nares, Thick nasal alae, Thick lower lip vermilion, Short palpebral fissure, Short nose, Everted lower lip vermilion, Joint hypermobility, Feeding difficulties, Failure to thrive, Recurrent otitis media, Intellectual disability, and Mild global developmental delay. However, the following features were excluded: Macrocephaly, Plagiocephaly, Microcephaly, Triangular face, Narrow forehead, Midface retrusion, Dolichocephaly, Blue sclerae, Ptosis, Hypopigmentation of the fundus, EEG abnormality, Seizure, Hypotonia, Hypertonia, Hearing impairment, Prominent forehead, Long eyelashes, Hypertelorism, Epicanthus, Upslanted palpebral fissure, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Depressed nasal bridge, Wide nose, Broad philtrum, Short philtrum, Thin upper lip vermilion, Wide mouth, Downturned corners of mouth, Macrotia, Protruding ear, Low-set ears, Posteriorly rotated ears, Simple ear, Uplifted earlobe, Microtia, Craniosynostosis, Delayed skeletal maturation, Scoliosis, Pectus excavatum, Brachydactyly, Clinodactyly, Absent distal phalanges, Prominent interphalangeal joints, Sparse scalp hair, Hypertrichosis, Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nails, Delayed eruption of primary teeth, Microdontia, Orofacial cleft, Sleep abnormality, Laryngotracheomalacia, Short stature, Moderate global developmental delay, Severe global developmental delay, and Autistic behavior.
