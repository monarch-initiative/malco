I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 11-month-old female infant. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
She presented with Depressed nasal bridge, Narrow forehead, Frontal bossing, Coarse facial features, Midface retrusion, Wide anterior fontanel, Diastasis recti, Abdominal distention, Dilated third ventricle, Lateral ventricle dilatation, Hydronephrosis, Bowing of the long bones, Broad ribs, Patent ductus arteriosus after birth at term, Patent foramen ovale, Hypertelorism, Low-set ears, and Talipes equinovarus. However, the following features were excluded: Abnormal fundus morphology.
During the fetal period, she presented with Polyhydramnios and Fetal pyelectasis. 
At an age of 8 months, she presented with Seizure, Severe hearing impairment, Feeding difficulties, Severely reduced visual acuity, Global developmental delay, and Postnatal growth retardation.
