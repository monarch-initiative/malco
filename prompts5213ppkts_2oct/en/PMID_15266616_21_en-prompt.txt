I am running an experiment on a clinical case report to see how your diagnoses compare with those of human experts.
I am going to give you part of a medical case. In this case, you are “Dr. GPT-4”, an AI language model who is providing
a diagnosis. Here are some guidelines. First, there is a single definitive diagnosis, and it is a diagnosis that is known
today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by some sort of genetic test, though in rare cases
when such a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical criteria or
very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. After you read the case, I want you to give a differential diagnosis with
a list of candidate diagnoses ranked by probability starting with the most likely candidate. Each candidate should be
specified with disease name. For instance, if the first candidate is Branchiooculofacial syndrome and the second is
Cystic fibrosis, provide this:

1. Branchiooculofacial syndrome
2. Cystic fibrosis

This list should provide as many diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning,
just list the diagnoses. Here is the case:

The proband was a 7-year, 3-month old boy. Disease onset occurred when the proband was a newborn.
He presented with High forehead, Broad forehead, Round face, Hypertelorism, Thick eyebrow, Highly arched eyebrow, Long eyelashes, Downslanted palpebral fissures, Ptosis, Exodeviation, Wide nasal bridge, Anteverted nares, Long philtrum, Thin upper lip vermilion, Everted lower lip vermilion, Microtia, Low-set ears, Short neck, Small hypothenar eminence, Long hallux, Short toe, and Abnormality of the genital system. However, the following features were excluded: Trigonocephaly, Flat occiput, Prominent occiput, Prominent forehead, Narrow forehead, Flat face, Triangular face, Broad face, Epicanthus, Sparse eyebrow, Deeply set eye, Proptosis, Iris coloboma, Cataract, Ectopia lentis, Esodeviation, Long nose, Bulbous nose, Hypoplastic nasal tip, Low hanging columella, Short philtrum, Smooth philtrum, Deep philtrum, Thick upper lip vermilion, Thin lower lip vermilion, Thick lower lip vermilion, High palate, Cleft palate, Abnormal dental morphology, Full cheeks, Posteriorly rotated ears, Conductive hearing impairment, Low anterior hairline, Brittle hair, Webbed neck, Small thenar eminence, Broad thumb, Pes planus, Talipes equinovarus, Hallux valgus, Toe clinodactyly, and Umbilical hernia.
