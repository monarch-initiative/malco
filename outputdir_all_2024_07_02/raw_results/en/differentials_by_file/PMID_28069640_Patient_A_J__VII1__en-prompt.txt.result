Based on the clinical presentation provided in the case, the differential diagnosis can include the following genetic disorders:

1. Noonan Syndrome
2. Costello Syndrome
3. Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome
4. LEOPARD Syndrome
5. Barth Syndrome
6. Trichorhinophalangeal Syndrome, Type I
7. Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy
8. Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation

These diagnoses are considered based on the combination of cardiac anomalies, distinctive hair characteristics, facial dysmorphisms, and developmental delays, among other features listed in the case and ruling out conditions which do not have associated pericardial effusion and specific dermatological and visual symptoms. Each of these genetic conditions can involve complex presentations and typically are confirmed via genetic testing.
