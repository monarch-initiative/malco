Based on the presentation described in the case, here are the potential differential diagnoses ranked by probability:

1. West Syndrome
2. Aicardi Syndrome
3. Lissencephaly
4. Zellweger Syndrome
5. D-Bifunctional Protein Deficiency
6. Rett Syndrome
7. Miller-Dieker Syndrome
8. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease

Each candidate reflects genetic conditions known to manifest with severe neurodevelopmental delay, structural brain anomalies, and specific features like hypsarrhythmia and infantile spasms, which are significant for forming a differential diagnosis list.
