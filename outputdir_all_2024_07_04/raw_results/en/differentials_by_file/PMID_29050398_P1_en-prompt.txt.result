Based on the provided clinical details and exclusion criteria, my differential diagnosis list would include the following ranked by probability:

1. Benign Rolandic Epilepsy
2. Landau-Kleffner Syndrome
3. Autosomal Dominant Frontal Lobe Epilepsy
4. Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes
5. Panayiotopoulos Syndrome 

This list reflects genetic and non-genetic considerations given the focal nature of the seizures and the age of onset, which align with known epileptic syndromes and disorders most commonly presenting in early childhood without broader, global neurodevelopmental impairments.
