Based on the clinical features described in the case, here is a differential diagnosis ranked by probability:

1. Noonan Syndrome
2. 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (DiGeorge Syndrome)
3. Turner Syndrome
4. Williams Syndrome
5. Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
6. Kabuki Syndrome
7. Treacher Collins Syndrome

Each of these candidate diagnoses is considered based on the constellation of physical and developmental symptoms presented, with a higher rank given to those more commonly associated with such a variety of findings. Genetic testing would be crucial to confirm the final diagnosis.
