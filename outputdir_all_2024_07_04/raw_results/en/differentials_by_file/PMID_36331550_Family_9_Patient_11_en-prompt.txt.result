Given the clinical features described in the patient case along with the exclusion of certain other features, here is the differential diagnosis ranked by probability:

1. Angelman Syndrome
2. Rett Syndrome
3. Fragile X Syndrome
4. Autism Spectrum Disorder (specific syndromic forms with known genetic bases)
5. Joubert Syndrome
6. Dandy-Walker Syndrome

This ranking is based on the presence of intellectual disability, motor delays, ataxia, and neuroimaging findings (cerebellar atrophy), alongside the history of early febrile seizures, which helps narrow down the list of potential genetic syndromes.
