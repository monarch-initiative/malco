Based on the case details provided for the 22-year-old woman with disease onset at 8 years old, and presenting with abnormal pyramidal signs, spastic paraplegia, and distal lower limb muscle weakness, my differential diagnosis ranked by probability would include:

1. Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia
2. Primary Lateral Sclerosis
3. Multiple Sclerosis
4. Spinal Cord Lesion or Compression
5. Cerebral Palsy (Spastic Diplegia type)
6. Friedreich's Ataxia (less likely due to absence of ataxia and other core features)
7. Myelitis or Transverse Myelitis
