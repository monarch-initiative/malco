Based on the presentation of multiple neurological and developmental symptoms along with distinct facial features, my differential diagnosis for this case would include:

1. Coffin-Siris Syndrome
2. Mowat-Wilson Syndrome
3. Rett Syndrome
4. Angelman Syndrome
5. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome
6. CHARGE Syndrome
7. Prader-Willi Syndrome
8. Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
9. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
10. Williams Syndrome

Each of these syndromes is a genetic disorder that may account for the various systemic and developmental symptoms observed in this patient, although specific genetic testing would be crucial for a definitive diagnosis.
