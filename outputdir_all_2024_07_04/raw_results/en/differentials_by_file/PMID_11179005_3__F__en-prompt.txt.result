Given the key symptoms of orofacial cleft, polycystic kidney dysplasia, polydactyly, brain imaging abnormalities, and a short 2nd toe, along with the exclusion of several other syndromic features, my differential diagnosis list, ranked by probability, includes:

1. Meckel-Gruber Syndrome
2. Pallister-Hall Syndrome
3. Orofaciodigital Syndrome
4. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome
5. Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome

Each of these diagnoses is tailored to include the typical genetic testing required for a definitive diagnosis and takes into account the provided symptoms and exclusions.
