Based on the provided clinical features, here is a differential diagnosis list ranked by probability:

1. Noonan Syndrome
2. Kabuki Syndrome
3. Costello Syndrome
4. Williams Syndrome
5. Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome
6. Loeys-Dietz Syndrome
7. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome

Each of these genetic disorders can present with several of the symptoms noted in the case, including distinctive facial features, developmental delays, and cardiac anomalies such as the Scimitar anomaly, despite not all being directly associated with all listed symptoms. Genetic testing would help in confirming the diagnosis among these possibilities.
