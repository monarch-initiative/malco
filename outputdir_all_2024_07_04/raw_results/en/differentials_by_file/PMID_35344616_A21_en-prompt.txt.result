Given the complex array of phenotypic manifestations presented in this case, particularly the combination of craniofacial, limb, and skeletal anomalies, here are the differential diagnoses ranked by probability:

1. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
2. Pfeiffer Syndrome
3. Carpenter Syndrome
4. Acrocephalosyndactylia Syndrome
5. Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome
6. Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
7. Catel-Manzke Syndrome

This ranking is primarily based on the combination and prevalence of the presenting features in each of these genetic disorders.
