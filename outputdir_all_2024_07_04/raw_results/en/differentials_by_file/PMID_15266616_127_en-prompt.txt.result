1. Apert Syndrome
2. Pfeiffer Syndrome
3. Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
4. Crouzon Syndrome
5. Carpenter Syndrome

Each of these syndromes has characteristic craniofacial, hand, or foot deformations, some of which match the description given in the medical case. However, the definitive diagnosis would depend on genetic testing and further clinical evaluations.
