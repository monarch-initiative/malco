Given the clinical presentation and exclusion of certain features, the list of differential diagnoses ranked by probability could be:

1. Kabuki syndrome
2. Noonan syndrome
3. Cornelia de Lange syndrome
4. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome
5. Williams syndrome
6. Smith-Magenis syndrome
7. CHARGE syndrome

This ranking is based on the match between the reported symptoms and characteristic features of each syndrome, though further clinical and genetic testing would be necessary for definitive diagnosis.
