Given the combination of physical and facial features presented in the case, the following differential diagnosis list is constructed, prioritizing genetic syndromes commonly associated with these manifestations:

1. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
2. Acrodysostosis
3. Pfeiffer Syndrome
4. Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
5. Carpenter Syndrome
6. Apert Syndrome
7. Muenke Syndrome
8. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome
9. Noonan Syndrome
10. Pallister-Killian Syndrome

Each candidate is selected based on the characteristic phenotypic traits associated with the syndrome, particularly focusing on skeletal dysplasia, craniofacial abnormalities, and other systemic involvements as described.
