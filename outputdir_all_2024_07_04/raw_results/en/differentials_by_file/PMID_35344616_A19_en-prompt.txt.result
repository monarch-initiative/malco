Based on the described symptoms and the exclusion of other potential features, my differential diagnosis includes:

1. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
2. Acrodysostosis
3. Carpenter Syndrome
4. Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
5. Pfeiffer Syndrome

Given the combination of skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and limb malformations, these conditions are most consistent with the described clinical features.
