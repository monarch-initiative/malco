Given the clinical features presented in this case, my differential diagnosis from most likely to less likely would include:

1. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome
2. Cri-du-chat Syndrome
3. Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome
4. Noonan Syndrome
5. Turner Syndrome
6. Prader-Willi Syndrome
7. Williams Syndrome
8. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome

10. Rett Syndrome

Each of these genetic disorders can present with a variety of overlapping symptoms as described in the case, often necessitating genetic testing for definitive diagnosis.
