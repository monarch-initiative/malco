Given the complex and extensive symptom profile you've described, and the requirement that the diagnosis is often confirmed by genetic testing or consensus clinical criteria, here are the most likely candidate diagnoses ranked by probability:

1. Pallister-Hall Syndrome
2. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
3. Costello Syndrome
4. Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
5. Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
6. Weaver Syndrome
7. Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome
8. 3C (Rosenberg-Chutorian) Syndrome
9. Marshall-Smith Syndrome
10. Carpenter Syndrome

These options reflect a range of genetic syndromes characterized by features similar to those described in the case report, including developmental anomalies, facial dysmorphisms, and various organ system impairments.
