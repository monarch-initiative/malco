Given the specified details and the exclusion of numerous features typically associated with various connective tissue disorders, here are my differential diagnoses ranked by probability:

1. Noonan Syndrome
2. Turner Syndrome
3. Williams Syndrome
4. Fragile X Syndrome
5. Klinefelter Syndrome
6. Prader-Willi Syndrome
7. Rett Syndrome
8. Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
9. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome
10. Cri-du-chat Syndrome

This list is based on common genetic syndromes, considering the absence of the typical features listed. The presentation and exclusion of features such as connective tissue abnormalities, bone density issues, and cardiac problems guide the differential towards other genetic conditions that might not primarily affect these systems.
