Based on the presented clinical features and the exclusion of certain syndromic indicators, I recommend evaluating the following differential diagnoses, ranked by probability:

1. Progeria (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome)
2. Werner Syndrome
3. Restrictive Dermopathy
4. Atypical Progeroid Syndrome
5. Acrogeria, Gottron Type
6. Cockayne Syndrome
7. Hallermann-Streiff Syndrome
8. Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome
9. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
10. Neonatal Progeroid Syndrome (Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch Syndrome)

These suggestions are based on overlap in symptomatic presentations with the listed conditions. Confirmation would typically require genetic testing where available.
