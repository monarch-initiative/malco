Given the clinical features presented in the case, the following differential diagnoses can be considered:

1. Retinitis Pigmentosa
2. Usher Syndrome (Type 2 or 3, considering absence of early hearing loss).
3. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (though absence of postaxial polydactyly and speech delay might argue against this).
4. Leber Congenital Amaurosis
5. Stargardt Disease

These diagnoses are ranked in order of likelihood based on the clinical features listed, with consideration for common genetic eye disorders presenting with similar symptoms.
