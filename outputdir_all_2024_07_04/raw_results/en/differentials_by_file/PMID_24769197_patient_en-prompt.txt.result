Based on the clinical presentation detailed in the case, here are the differential diagnoses ranked by probability:
1. Hurler Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type I)
2. Morquio Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV)
3. Hunter Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type II)
4. Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI)
5. Williams Syndrome
6. Noonan Syndrome
7. Costello Syndrome
8. Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome

These conditions are linked by dysostosis multiplex and other systemic and facial manifestations, though they differ in severity and specific enzyme deficiencies or genetic mutations. Notably, the absence of certain symptoms like cherry red spot of the macula and hepatosplenomegaly helps narrow the potential types of mucopolysaccharidoses and other similar syndromic diagnoses.
