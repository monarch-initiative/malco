Given the clinical presentation and specific findings in this case report along with the assurance that the condition is often diagnosed through genetic testing, I would suggest the following differential diagnoses ranked by likelihood:

1. Marfan Syndrome
2. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
3. Loeys-Dietz Syndrome
4. Muscular Dystrophy-Duchenne/Becker (less likely due to specific phenotype)
5. Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly (Beals Syndrome)
6. Smith-Magenis Syndrome (less likely due to genetic testing being confirmatory in most cases)

Each of these diagnoses presents with some overlapping symptoms, particularly involving joint issues, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological manifestations that align with the patient's presentation. However, they are distinguished by genetic markers that can be tested to confirm the diagnosis.
